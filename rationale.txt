1) I chose java in order to see how much i remember since i have been using c# for almost 5 years.
2) i implemented a page object model even though we only have one page in order for the project to be scalable.
3) Added parallelism for the same reason. Right now we have 10 tests but maybe in the future we are time bottlenecked.
4) Since most rainy scenario tests are completely the same i contemplated a lot about using a data provider (something like DataRow in MSTest c#) in order to have one test for all the different inputs. I ended up doing different tests because i think its a cleaner way.
5) I thought about doing a logging, video mechanism but i thought that was a bit overkill.
6) Iff the elements or the methods in a page become too many we could create a new class to differentiate elements from methods
